You are an expert Front-End UI Developer, Motion Graphics Designer, and Asset Pipeline Engineer working on a product called Profile Lab — a customizable profile page editor inspired by Discord profile effects.
Goal: Create three high-quality animated profile entrance effects (like Discord Profile Effects) using a modern React + Framer Motion + Lottie setup.
Effects must be optimized, lightweight, and exported as reusable assets.
Effects Requirements:
1️⃣ Neon Aura Glow
animated glow ring around profile avatar
colors: purple + pink neon stack
subtle pulsing loop
export as Lottie JSON + preview MP4/PNG sequence
2️⃣ Sparkle Particles
floating sparkle particles, random opacity
follows parallax motion
WebGL or Lottie format
60fps smooth
3️⃣ Burst Entrance Pop
quick glow burst behind profile card
scale animation synced with card entrance
shockwave ring asset (SVG + Lottie format)
Output Files:
/assets/effects/aura-glow.json (Lottie)
/assets/effects/sparkles.json
/assets/effects/burst.json
Export preview transparent PNG spritesheets
Documentation for integration
Code Implementation:
Create a folder: /src/components/effects/
Create React wrapper components:
AuraGlowEffect.jsx
SparkleEffect.jsx
BurstEntranceEffect.jsx
These components must include:
✔ Framer Motion entrance animations for Profile Card
✔ Toggle props (enabled, intensity, speed)
✔ Positioned absolutely inside card preview container
Install dependencies:
Copy code
Bash
npm install framer-motion lottie-react
Integration Task:
Add a new tab "Entrance Effects" into the Customization Center:
displays thumbnails for each effect
click to apply effect in real-time
live preview in Profile Preview panel
autosave selection to local storage JSON config
Provide:
✔ React UI code for the tab interface
✔ Props system for modifying effects
✔ Example state management (Context or Zustand)
Final Deliverables for This Task:
Animated assets
React effect components
Integration into LAB UI
Demo preview inside Replit
Small README showing how to add more effects later
Style + Quality Specs:
Dark UI with Neon Purple/Pink highlight theme
Same aesthetic language as Discord effects
No heavy video formats — prioritize vector and Lottie
Maintain >90fps GPU performance
When you finish:
✔ Show effects in a live preview webpage
✔ Provide download buttons for the asset files
✔ Display thumbnails + preview toggle
Begin by generating the assets first, then build the UI around them.
